      <title>[Letter] 1849 Dec. 12, Hanover College [Indiana] [to] Parents [Mr. and Mrs. Ethel Henry Porter] / Edward [Porter]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written by Edward Porter to his parents on December 12, 1849. In the letter, Edward discusses the events taking place with his sister, Mary, at her school. He writes to their parents how unhappy she is there, and that she has not written home because she does not like her teacher, Mr. Anderson, to read her letters before she sends them. Edward tells them that the teacher will not send her letters if she writes something disagreeable to him, and has threatened her with expulsion if she does not act better and do as he wishes. Edward concludes the letter by describing what he has been doing at Hanover College and about the social events at the school and in Hanover.</abstract>
